        Using the notes cli is easy. It can be used with most
        text editors, writes notes to the file system, and
        supports backups via git.

        To get started, just type `notes`.

            $ notes     # opens a note for today's date in vim

        By default, a note is opened with the current date as
        its name. If you want to open a note for a different day,
        use the offset flag `-o`.

            $ notes -o -1   # uses the current date -1 day
                            # positive numbers get future dates

        To open a note tied to a subject rather than a date, just
        type a title immediately after.

            $ notes grocery-list    # opens a note titled
                                    # "grocery-list"

        Both the date method and subject method are valid ways to
        create notes. Use the first method for daily notes, and
        the second for anything else. The date method is more akin
        to journaling. It's great for writing your thoughts down,
        tracking your schedule, creating daily checklists, etc.
        Named notes are great for writing down information for
        reference in the future; for example, writing down useful
        links, notes on presentations, or planning events.

        By default notes are opened in vim. You can use any editor
        which lets you open a file from the command line. Use the
        editor flag `-e` or EDITOR environment variable to use a
        different editor.

            $ notes -e nano     # opens today's note in nano

              or

            $ notes -e "open -a typora" # opens in typora (mac)

        You can also use more complex commands to launch a better
        editor.
